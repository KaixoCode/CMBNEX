### What is CMBNEX?
CMBNEX Is a 4 oscillator VST3 synth with a unique tuneable 2 dimensional waveshaper and 3 combiners that use several algorithms to combine incoming signals. All parameters have 4 slots for internal modulation from several modulation sources like envelopes, LFOs, and macros.

### Donate
I am making this synth publicly available for free, because I can't be bothered to go through the trouble
of setting up an entire webshop for this. But it would be awesome if you would consider donating!
